Focus 
1.	Define and call simple functions 
2.	Passing parameters to functions
3.	Variable scope
Part 1A: Design a Solution
For this portion of the lab, you will reuse the program you wrote in Lab 4.  Redesign this solution using functions.
For this lab:
1.	You will define a function names main().
2.	You will get input in the main function and pass it to the following functions:
a.	milesToKm()
b.	FahToCel()
c.	GalToLit()
d.	PoundsToKg()
e.	InchesToCm(). 
3.	Each function will require that you have a local variable to store the result of the calculation.
This result will then be displayed using the print statement from within the function.
Part 1B: Code
Use the design you created in part A.  Write a complete and syntactically correct Python program.  Use the IDLE programming environment.  Pleas save your file as firstname_lastname_Lab5A.py where you will replace firstname and lastname with your actual first name and last name.  Remember to use the extension .py.
Run and test your program.  Once you are sure it works you will turn in the items listed in the next section. 
All labs will be graded in Blackboard.  Once you are done with the lab turn it using the Lab 5 part 1 link.  

For this lab you will turn into Blackboard the following ONE item:
1. The Python code file you save in part 1B.  cassandra_francis_lab5a.py

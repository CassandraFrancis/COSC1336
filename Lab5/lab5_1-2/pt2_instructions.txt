For this portion of the lab, you will reuse the program you wrote in Lab 5 Part1 A.  Redesign this solution in the following manner:
4.	All of the functions used must now be value returning functions.
5.	Put the functions in an external module and let the main program import the module.
6.	Save the program as firstname_lastname_Lab5Ba.py where you will replace firstname and lastname with your actual first and last name.
All labs will be graded in Blackboard. Once you are done with the lab turn it in to the Lab 5 part 2 link.  

For this lab you will turn into Blackboard the following ONE item:
